# SaveMe App

## Description

This is a simple app that allows you to save recommendations for initially books I wanted to read. Includes a search function to find book details via an api and option to save them to your list.

Future dev to include other media plus links to websites and simple text notes.

## API used

[Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/using)
This may require OAuth 2.0 set up to use? Will be fun adding google login to this app.
API / OAuth not required for search function.

Current status, hard coded search and render to screen. Next step is to add a search bar and input field.
Then add a save button to select the book required and save to the list.

FInal step link to firebase DB to save the list. (live updates)
